AutonomicJavaService: Building a Self-Healing Java Service with AI

This project demonstrates the foundational concepts for building a self-healing Java service, leveraging a rule-based "AI" model to detect and automatically remediate common application failures in runtime. As modern distributed systems grow in complexity, manual intervention for every incident becomes unsustainable. This sample illustrates how automated monitoring, anomaly detection, and corrective actions can enhance service reliability and reduce operational overhead.

Problem Statement:
Java applications, like any software, can encounter various runtime issues such as high CPU utilization, memory exhaustion, or performance bottlenecks. Traditionally, these issues are detected by monitoring tools, and then a human operator is alerted to manually diagnose and fix the problem. This process is reactive, slow, and prone to human error, leading to increased downtime and operational costs.

Solution Overview:
AutonomicJavaService proposes an architecture where the service itself is equipped with "awareness" and "intelligence" to self-diagnose and self-heal. It incorporates:
1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Actively collects runtime metrics (simulated CPU, memory, response times).
2.  **AI-driven Anomaly Detection:** A simplified, rule-based AI model analyzes these metrics in real-time to identify patterns indicative of a failure.
3.  **Automated Healing:** Upon detecting an anomaly, the system triggers predefined remediation actions to restore the service to a healthy state without human intervention.

Key Components:
*   **Service Controller (com.autonomic.java.service.controller.ServiceController):** Exposes REST endpoints for health checks, simulated failure injection (e.g., /simulate/cpu-spike, /simulate/memory-leak), and current metrics.
*   **Service Monitor (com.autonomic.java.service.monitor.ServiceMonitor):** A scheduled component that periodically collects simulated runtime metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, response latency). It feeds this data to the AnomalyDetector.
*   **Anomaly Detector (com.autonomic.java.service.ai.AnomalyDetector):** This is our "AI" component. For this sample, it's a rule-based system that evaluates incoming metrics against predefined thresholds and patterns to classify anomalies (e.g., HIGH_CPU, HIGH_MEMORY, SLOW_RESPONSE). In a real-world scenario, this could be replaced by more sophisticated machine learning models.
*   **Healing Service (com.autonomic.java.service.healing.HealingService):** Orchestrates the remediation process. Based on the anomaly type identified by the AnomalyDetector, it invokes the appropriate RemediationAction.
*   **Remediation Actions (com.autonomic.java.service.healing.impl.*):** Concrete implementations of healing strategies. Examples include simulating cache clears, thread cleanups, or resource resets.

How to Run the Project:
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Java 17 (or compatible version) and Apache Maven installed.
2.  **Clone/Download:** Obtain the project files.
3.  **Build:** Navigate to the project root directory (where pom.xml is located) in your terminal and run:
    mvn clean install
4.  **Run:** Execute the Spring Boot application:
    mvn spring-boot:run
    The service will start on http://localhost:8080.

How to Test and Observe Healing:
1.  **Access Health Check:**
    Open your browser or use curl:
    http://localhost:8080/health
    You should see "Status: UP".
2.  **Monitor Metrics:**
    Observe the simulated metrics:
    http://localhost:8080/metrics
    Initially, metrics should be low/normal.
3.  **Trigger a CPU Spike:**
    Call the simulation endpoint:
    http://localhost:8080/simulate/cpu-spike
    Observe your application logs. You will see messages from ServiceMonitor detecting high CPU, AnomalyDetector identifying it, and HealingService executing a remediation action. The CPU usage in /metrics will eventually normalize.
4.  **Trigger a Memory Leak (Simulated):**
    Call the simulation endpoint:
    http://localhost:8080/simulate/memory-leak
    Again, check logs for detection and healing. The memory usage in /metrics will increase and then be "remediated" (simulated).
5.  **Trigger Slow Responses:**
    Call the simulation endpoint:
    http://localhost:8080/simulate/slow-response
    Observe the latency metric increase and then be remediated.

Look for log messages indicating:
- "[ServiceMonitor]" collecting metrics.
- "[AnomalyDetector]" detecting an anomaly (e.g., "Anomaly detected: HIGH_CPU").
- "[HealingService]" performing remediation (e.g., "Performing healing for HIGH_CPU: Optimizing CPU-intensive operations").

Limitations and Future Enhancements:
*   **Simplified AI:** The "AI" model here is a basic rule-based system for demonstration. A real-world AI model would involve machine learning, trained on vast amounts of historical telemetry data to predict and classify anomalies more accurately, potentially even before they cause impact.
*   **Simulated Failures & Remediation:** Failures are injected artificially, and healing actions are symbolic (e.g., printing a message). In a production system, these would interact with actual system resources (e.g., adjusting thread pools, clearing real caches, restarting microservices, or scaling resources).
*   **State Management:** This sample is stateless. A robust self-healing system would need persistent state to avoid repetitive healing actions, track incident history, and learn over time.
*   **Feedback Loop:** A true self-healing system would incorporate a feedback loop, learning from the success or failure of its remediation actions to improve future responses.
*   **External Integration:** Integration with advanced monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana), logging platforms (ELK stack), and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) would be essential for production use.
*   **Sophisticated Remediation:** More advanced healing could involve dynamic resource scaling, circuit breakers, bulkheads, or even code hot-swapping.

This project serves as a conceptual blueprint, encouraging further exploration into building resilient, autonomous Java services.
