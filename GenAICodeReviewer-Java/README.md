This project, GenAICodeReviewer-Java, demonstrates how to automate Java code and pull request reviews using Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI tools. By integrating a custom Java application with GitHub Actions, you can set up an automated review bot that provides intelligent feedback on new code changes.

How It Works:
1. A GitHub Pull Request is opened or updated in a Java project.
2. The 'java-code-review.yml' GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
3. The workflow fetches the diff (changes) of the pull request.
4. It then executes a custom Java application, passing the diff content as input.
5. The Java application sends the code diff to a configured Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or a self-hosted LLM).
6. The LLM analyzes the code changes and generates review comments based on predefined instructions (e.g., identifying potential bugs, style violations, performance issues, security vulnerabilities, or best practice suggestions).
7. The Java application parses the LLM's response and outputs a structured JSON list of comments.
8. The GitHub Actions workflow captures this JSON output and uses the GitHub API to post these comments directly onto the pull request.

Project Structure:
- .github/workflows/java-code-review.yml: The GitHub Actions workflow definition.
- src/main/java/...: Contains the core Java application logic.
  - App.java: Main entry point, orchestrates diff processing, LLM call, and comment generation.
  - LlmService.java: Handles communication with the LLM API.
  - ReviewComment.java: Data structure for a review comment.
- build.gradle: Gradle build script for the Java application.

Prerequisites:
- A GitHub repository for your Java project.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
- Gradle build tool (for local development/testing).
- An API key for your chosen Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI API Key).
- A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'repo' scope (usually the default GITHUB_TOKEN provided by GitHub Actions is sufficient for PR comments).

Setup Instructions:

1. Clone this repository or integrate these files into your existing Java project.
2. Configure LLM API Key:
   - For GitHub Actions, add your LLM API key as a GitHub Secret. For example, create a repository secret named LLM_API_KEY.
   - The Java application will read this key from an environment variable.
3. Place the java-code-review.yml file in your .github/workflows/ directory.
4. Ensure the Java source files are correctly placed under src/main/java/com/example/genai/codereviewer/.
5. Ensure the build.gradle file is at the root of your project.

Running the Automation:

1. Open a Pull Request in your configured GitHub repository (or push new commits to an existing PR).
2. The 'Java Code Review' workflow will automatically start.
3. Monitor the workflow run in the 'Actions' tab of your repository.
4. Once completed, navigate to your Pull Request to see the LLM-generated review comments.

Customization and Further Development:

- LLM Prompt Engineering: Refine the prompt in LlmService.java to guide the LLM to provide more specific, helpful, or concise feedback. Experiment with different roles, examples, and output formats.
- LLM Model Choice: Easily switch between different LLMs by modifying the LlmService.java to integrate with other APIs (e.g., Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude). Remember to update the API request/response format accordingly.
- Code Analysis Depth: Currently, the LLM processes the raw diff. For deeper analysis, consider passing the full file content, AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), or specific code metrics to the LLM. This would require more complex logic in the Java application to gather and format this data.
- Filtering Comments: Implement logic in App.java to filter or prioritize LLM comments (e.g., ignore suggestions below a certain confidence score, group similar comments).
- Comment Formatting: Improve how comments are posted to GitHub (e.g., using specific markdown, linking to relevant documentation).
- Error Handling and Retries: Enhance the Java application with robust error handling for API calls, including retry mechanisms for transient failures.

Important Considerations:
- Cost: Be mindful of the cost associated with LLM API usage, especially for large diffs or frequent PRs.
- Accuracy: LLMs can sometimes hallucinate or provide incorrect suggestions. Human oversight is still crucial. This automation is a helpful assistant, not a replacement for human review.
- Data Privacy: Be aware of what code data you are sending to external LLM providers. For highly sensitive code, consider self-hosted or on-premises LLMs.
- Rate Limits: Respect API rate limits for both LLM and GitHub APIs.

This project provides a foundational framework. Adapt and extend it to fit your specific code review needs and organizational policies.
