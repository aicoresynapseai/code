Project: ChatOpsGenAIDevOps - Integrating Java DevOps Pipelines with GenAI Bots

Description:
This project demonstrates a ChatOps solution that integrates Java DevOps pipelines with a Generative AI (GenAI) bot. The core idea is to enable developers and operations teams to automate and monitor Java application deployments directly from a chat interface (e.g., Discord) by interacting with a bot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) backend (like OpenAI's GPT).

The bot acts as an intelligent assistant, interpreting natural language commands from users, validating them using the LLM, and then triggering predefined DevOps actions (like deploying a Java application) via backend scripts. It also provides real-time feedback and status updates back to the chat.

Key Features:
*   **Chat Interface:** Utilizes Discord as the primary chat platform for interacting with the bot.
*   **Generative AI Backend:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to understand natural language, validate commands, and generate informative responses.
*   **Java DevOps Integration:** Triggers simulated Java application deployments using a simple shell script, demonstrating how real CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) could be integrated.
*   **Spring Boot Application:** The bot's backend is built with Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable foundation.
*   **Automated Monitoring & Feedback:** Provides instant status updates and deployment logs back to the chat channel.

Architecture Overview:
User -> Discord Chat -> Discord Bot (Java Spring Boot)
                               |
                               |-> OpenAI API (LLM for NLU & Response Generation)
                               |
                               |-> DeploymentService (Triggers shell scripts for simulated deployments)
                               |
                               |-> Shell Script (Simulates Java application deployment)

Setup and Running Instructions:

1.  Prerequisites:
    *   Java 17 or higher
    *   Maven
    *   A Discord Account
    *   An OpenAI Account with API access

2.  Discord Bot Setup:
    *   Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    *   Click "New Application", give it a name (e.g., "ChatOpsDevBot").
    *   Navigate to the "Bot" tab on the left sidebar.
    *   Click "Add Bot", then "Yes, do it!".
    *   Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT". This is crucial for the bot to read messages.
    *   Click "Reset Token" and copy the token. This will be your `discord.bot.token`. **Keep this token private!**
    *   Go to the "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator" tab.
    *   Under "Scopes", select `bot`.
    *   Under "Bot Permissions", select at least `Send Messages` and `Read Message History`.
    *   Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your Discord server.

3.  OpenAI API Key:
    *   Sign up or log in to OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/).
    *   Go to "API keys" section (often under your profile or "API" in the left menu).
    *   Click "Create new secret key" and copy the key. This will be your `openai.api.key`. **Keep this key private!**

4.  Project Setup:
    *   Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
    *   Navigate into the project directory: `cd ChatOpsGenAIDevOps`
    *   Create `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or modify the existing one if provided) and populate it with your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key:
        discord.bot.token=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
        openai.api.key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
        openai.model.name=gpt-3.5-turbo
        # Path to the deployment script. Use absolute path for robustness.
        deployment.script.path=./scripts/deploy_java_app.sh

5.  Build the Project:
    *   Open your terminal in the project root directory.
    *   Run: `mvn clean install`

6.  Run the Application:
    *   From the project root: `java -jar target/ChatOpsGenAIDevOps-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    *   The bot should come online in your Discord server.

Usage:
Once the bot is online, you can interact with it in your Discord channel. The bot is designed to interpret natural language commands related to deployments.

Example Commands:
*   `@ChatOpsDevBot deploy application to staging latest version`
*   `@ChatOpsDevBot check status of production environment`
*   `@ChatOpsDevBot rollback the app on dev to v1.2.3`
*   `@ChatOpsDevBot help` (This will prompt the LLM to give general help)
*   `@ChatOpsDevBot what can you do?` (LLM will try to interpret and respond)

The bot will use the LLM to understand your intent and parameters, then trigger the corresponding action (e.g., `deploy_java_app.sh staging latest`). It will then report the outcome back to Discord.

Extend and Customize:
*   **More DevOps Actions:** Add services for CI/CD pipeline triggers (e.g., Jenkins API calls, GitLab CI webhooks), monitoring tools integration (Prometheus, Grafana), or cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   **Advanced LLM Interaction:** Implement more sophisticated prompt engineering for the LLM to handle complex scenarios, generate test data, or even write small code snippets.
*   **User Authentication/Authorization:** Add logic to restrict certain commands to specific Discord roles or users.
*   **Different Chat Platforms:** Adapt the `DiscordBotListener` and `DiscordConfig` to support Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.
*   **Real CI/CD:** Replace `deploy_java_app.sh` with actual API calls to your CI/CD system.
