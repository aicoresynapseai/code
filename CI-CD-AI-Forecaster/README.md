CI-CD-AI-Forecaster

Welcome to CI-CD-AI-Forecaster, an example project demonstrating predictive analytics for Java DevOps pipelines. This tutorial focuses on forecasting potential build or deployment issues by leveraging historical CI/CD data and conceptual integration with Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities.

The core idea is to analyze past pipeline runs—including build status, test outcomes, deployment phases, and error messages—to identify patterns that precede failures or bottlenecks. While a full GenAI model training and deployment is beyond a single sample, this project provides the architecture and a simulated GenAI interaction point.

Key Components:

*   BuildData Model: Represents a single historical record of a CI/CD pipeline run, including status, duration, and a simulated error description.
*   HistoricalDataLoader: Responsible for loading simulated historical build data from a CSV file. In a real scenario, this would connect to Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, or other CI/CD platform APIs.
*   PredictionService: This is the heart of the predictive analytics. It takes the historical data and applies logic to forecast potential issues. This component conceptually integrates with GenAI:
    *   It simulates using GenAI to "analyze" error descriptions and classify them.
    *   It demonstrates how GenAI could identify potential root causes or suggest remediation based on patterns.
*   PipelineFailurePredictorApp: The main application entry point that orchestrates data loading, prediction, and output.
*   Data: A sample CSV file (data/historical_builds.csv) containing mock historical build data.
*   Configuration: application.properties for any external settings, like a placeholder for a GenAI API key.
*   Containerization: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy deployment and testing.

How to Run This Project:

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
*   Apache Maven 3.6.3 or higher
*   Docker Desktop (for containerized deployment)

Step-by-step Execution:

1.  Clone the repository:
    Use your Git client to clone this project to your local machine. For example:
    git clone your-repository-url-here
    cd CI-CD-AI-Forecaster

2.  Build the application:
    Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project (CI-CD-AI-Forecaster) in your terminal.
    Execute the Maven build command:
    mvn clean install

3.  Run directly from the JAR:
    After a successful build, a JAR file will be created in the target directory. You can run it directly:
    java -jar target/ci-cd-ai-forecaster.jar

    You will see output in your console showing the loaded data and the simulated predictions.

4.  Build and Run with Docker:
    For a containerized experience, first build the Docker image:
    docker build -t ci-cd-ai-forecaster .

    Then, run the container:
    docker run ci-cd-ai-forecaster

    Alternatively, use Docker Compose for an even simpler setup:
    docker-compose up --build

    This will build the image (if not already built) and run the application within a Docker container.

Simulated GenAI Integration:

In this example, the GenAI integration is simulated within the PredictionService. A real-world application would involve:
*   Sending prompts to a large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI Service).
*   The prompt would include historical build logs, error messages, and context about the Java CI/CD pipeline.
*   The LLM's response would then be parsed to extract classifications (e.g., "Dependency Issue," "Test Failure," "Environment Mismatch"), potential root causes, or even suggested code fixes or configuration changes.
*   This project demonstrates *where* such an interaction would occur and *what kind* of insights could be derived.

Data Format (data/historical_builds.csv):

The historical_builds.csv file has the following columns:
*   buildId: Unique identifier for the build.
*   timestamp: When the build occurred.
*   durationSeconds: How long the build took.
*   status: "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE".
*   testCount: Number of tests executed.
*   failedTests: Number of failed tests.
*   deploymentSuccess: "TRUE" or "FALSE" indicating deployment status.
*   errorMessage: A simplified description of any error encountered.

Future Enhancements:

*   Integrate with a real GenAI API for actual predictive analysis and root cause identification.
*   Connect to actual CI/CD platform APIs (Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub Actions) for live data ingestion.
*   Develop a user interface for visualizing predictions and historical trends.
*   Implement more sophisticated machine learning models for failure prediction alongside or instead of rule-based logic.
*   Add alerting mechanisms for forecasted issues.
