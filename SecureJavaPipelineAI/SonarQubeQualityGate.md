## Sample SonarQube Quality Gate for AI-Enhanced Security

A SonarQube Quality Gate defines a set of conditions that a project must meet to be considered "production ready." When integrating AI/ML capabilities, these gates become even more powerful, incorporating insights that go beyond traditional rule-based detection.

Here's a sample Quality Gate configuration, highlighting how AI insights would be integrated:

---

### Quality Gate Name: `Secure Java DevOps Standard`

**Conditions for New Code (Recommended for Pull Requests/Merge Requests):**

*   **Reliability Rating:** `is 'A'`
    *   *AI Enhancement:* AI models can help prioritize critical bugs by assessing their real-world impact based on context and data flow.
*   **Security Rating:** `is 'A'`
    *   *AI Enhancement:* This is where AI truly shines. The security rating would reflect not just known rule violations, but also issues identified by ML models as high-risk.
*   **Maintainability Rating:** `is 'A'`
*   **Vulnerabilities (New Code):** `is less than 0` (i.e., no new vulnerabilities)
    *   *AI Enhancement:* Includes vulnerabilities detected by AI/ML plugins, such as complex data flow issues leading to deserialization vulnerabilities or subtle command injections missed by traditional regex.
*   **High-Risk AI-Identified Patterns (New Code):** `is less than 1` (Custom metric, requires AI plugin)
    *   *Description:* This is a hypothetical custom metric provided by an AI/ML SonarQube plugin. It tracks the number of code patterns identified by the ML model as having a *high probability* of leading to a severe security flaw (e.g., specific combinations of untrusted input processing, reflection, and library calls that form an exploit chain, even if individual components don't violate a simple rule).
*   **Security Hotspots (New Code):** `is less than 5` (or a low number)
    *   *AI Enhancement:* AI can help prioritize hotspots by providing a higher "confidence score" or "exploitability likelihood" based on contextual analysis, allowing developers to focus on the most critical areas.
*   **Duplication (New Code):** `is less than 3%` (Code duplication can sometimes hide vulnerabilities or make them harder to fix)

**Conditions for Overall Code (Optional, for full project baseline):**

*   **Security Rating:** `is 'A'`
*   **Vulnerabilities (Overall):** `is less than a defined threshold` (e.g., 10 for a small project, 0 for critical ones)
*   **High-Risk AI-Identified Patterns (Overall):** `is less than a defined threshold` (e.g., 0 or a very low number, ensuring no known high-risk patterns persist)

**How AI Integrates with Quality Gates:**

When an AI/ML-driven plugin performs a scan, it identifies issues and "security hot-spots" that are fed into SonarQube's analysis results. These findings then directly influence the Security Rating and the count of Vulnerabilities/Security Hotspots.

*   **Direct Vulnerability Detection:** If an AI model detects a subtle deserialization vulnerability (as described in the video's example), it would be reported as a Critical or Major vulnerability in SonarQube, directly failing the "Vulnerabilities (New Code)" condition if it's a new issue.
*   **Custom Metrics for High-Risk Patterns:** Commercial AI SAST tools often provide their own metrics or "rules" that represent their advanced findings. These can be integrated into SonarQube and then used within the Quality Gate (e.g., the "High-Risk AI-Identified Patterns" metric above).
*   **Hotspot Prioritization:** AI can enrich existing "Security Hotspot" findings with contextual information, helping security teams and developers decide which hotspots require immediate manual review based on their assessed exploitability likelihood.

By incorporating these AI-enhanced conditions, the Quality Gate acts as an intelligent, non-negotiable checkpoint in the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that code with even complex or subtle security flaws does not progress to later stages of deployment.
