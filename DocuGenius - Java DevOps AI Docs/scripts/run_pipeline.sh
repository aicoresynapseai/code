# DocuGenius - Java DevOps AI Docs - Simulated CI/CD Pipeline Script

# This script simulates a simple CI/CD pipeline for the Java application.
# It includes steps for building, testing, and crucially, for
# automated documentation generation using GenAI.

echo "--- Starting Simulated CI/CD Pipeline ---"

# Step 1: Build Java Application with Maven
echo ""
echo "--- Stage: Build Java Application ---"
# Clean and install Maven project. This compiles Java code, runs unit tests defined in pom.xml,
# and packages the application (e.g., into a JAR file).
mvn clean install

# Check if the Maven build was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Maven build failed. Aborting pipeline."
    exit 1
fi
echo "Java application built successfully."

# Step 2: Run Tests (Placeholder for actual test execution)
# In a real pipeline, this would involve running integration tests,
# functional tests, security scans, etc.
echo ""
echo "--- Stage: Run Tests (Placeholder) ---"
echo "Running application tests... (simulated)"
# For demonstration, we just sleep. In reality, you'd run commands like:
# java -jar target/automated-docs-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
# PID=$!
# curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/products # Make a test API call
# kill $PID
sleep 2
echo "Tests completed (simulated)."

# Step 3: Automated Documentation Generation using GenAI
echo ""
echo "--- Stage: Generate Automated Documentation with GenAI ---"
echo "Invoking Python script for documentation generation..."
# This step calls the Python script that interacts with the GenAI API.
# It reads code, configurations, and pipeline scripts to generate/update documentation.
python "$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/generate_docs.py"

# Check if the documentation generation was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Documentation generation failed or encountered issues."
fi
echo "Automated documentation generation completed."

# Step 4: Deployment (Placeholder)
# In a real pipeline, this would involve deploying the application to a server,
# container registry (Docker), or cloud platform (AWS, Azure, OCI, GCP).
echo ""
echo "--- Stage: Deploy Application (Placeholder) ---"
echo "Deploying application to environment... (simulated)"
sleep 1
echo "Application deployed (simulated)."

echo ""
echo "--- CI/CD Pipeline Finished Successfully ---"
echo "Check the 'docs/' directory for generated documentation."
