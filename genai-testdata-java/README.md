Project Title: GenAI-Driven Test Data Generation for Java Pipelines

Description:
This project demonstrates a conceptual approach to leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) models for creating diverse and realistic test datasets in Java applications, specifically for JUnit and Selenium tests. Manual test data creation is often tedious, prone to biases, and lacks the variety needed to thoroughly test all edge cases. By prompting GenAI models, developers can generate high-quality, context-aware data that mimics real-world scenarios, significantly improving test coverage and reliability.

How it works:
The core idea revolves around using natural language prompts to guide a GenAI model in producing structured data. For instance, you could prompt the AI with "Generate 10 realistic user profiles including names, emails, and ages for an e-commerce platform, ensuring some users are under 18 and some over 65." The GenAI model would then return a JSON or similar structured output which our Java application parses and uses for testing.

Key Components:
1.  **GenAIDataGenerator.java**: This class simulates the interaction with a GenAI model. In a real-world scenario, this would involve API calls to services like OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or others. For this example, it programmatically generates diverse data based on the *concept* of a prompt, illustrating the output diversity GenAI could provide.
2.  **User.java & UserService.java**: A simple model and service layer representing a typical application component that would require testing.
3.  **UserServiceTest.java**: A JUnit test class that utilizes the test data generated by GenAIDataGenerator. This demonstrates how generated data seamlessly integrates into your existing test suite.
4.  **SeleniumUserRegistrationTest.java**: A conceptual Selenium test that shows how the generated user data could be used in end-to-end browser automation tests. (Note: This is a placeholder and does not include actual Selenium WebDriver setup, focusing solely on data usage.)

Benefits:
-   **Enhanced Diversity**: Automatically generate a wide range of data, including edge cases and unexpected variations.
-   **Realism**: Data that mimics real-world patterns and constraints, making tests more robust.
-   **Reduced Manual Effort**: Automate the most time-consuming part of test data creation.
-   **Faster Iteration**: Quickly generate new datasets for different test scenarios.

How to Run:
This project uses Maven.
1.  Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher and Maven installed.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
3.  Compile the project: mvn clean install
4.  Run all tests: mvn test

This setup provides a foundational understanding of integrating GenAI into your Java test pipelines, paving the way for more intelligent and efficient testing strategies.
