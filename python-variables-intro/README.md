# Getting Started with Python and Variables

Welcome to the `python-variables-intro` project! This repository provides a simple, hands-on introduction to Python programming. You'll learn the very basics: how to set up Python, write your first program, and work with different types of variables (strings, integers, floats, and booleans).

## Project Description

This project serves as an introductory guide to Python syntax and fundamental concepts. It covers:
- Installing Python on your system.
- Writing and executing your first Python script.
- Understanding and using variables to store different kinds of data (text, whole numbers, decimal numbers, and true/false values).
- Interacting with the user by taking input and displaying information back.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your computer.

1.  **Download Python:**
    If you don't have Python installed, visit the official Python website: `https://www.python.org/downloads/` and download the latest stable version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.
    
    *   **Important:** During installation on Windows, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" or "Add Python.exe to PATH" to make it easier to run Python from your command line.

2.  **Verify Installation:**
    Open your command prompt or terminal and type:
    `python --version`
    or
    `python3 --version`
    
    You should see the installed Python version (e.g., `Python 3.9.7`).

3.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    Save the `main.py` file (provided below) into a folder on your computer. Let's assume you save it in a folder named `python-variables-intro`.
    Open your command prompt or terminal, and navigate to this folder using the `cd` command:
    `cd path/to/your/python-variables-intro`
    (Replace `path/to/your/python-variables-intro` with the actual path to your folder.)

## How to Run the Program

Once you are in the `python-variables-intro` directory in your terminal:

1.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the Python script using the Python interpreter:
    `python main.py`
    or
    `python3 main.py` (if `python` command doesn't work or refers to an older version).

2.  **Follow the Prompts:**
    The program will execute step-by-step, printing output to the console. It will also prompt you to enter some information. Type your responses and press Enter.

## What You Will See

The script will:
- Print a welcoming message.
- Demonstrate how to declare and use string, integer, float, and boolean variables.
- Ask for your name and favorite color, store them, and then print them back to you.

Feel free to open `main.py` in a text editor and experiment with changing the variable values or adding new print statements!
