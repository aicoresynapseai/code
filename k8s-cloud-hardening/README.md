Securing Kubernetes in the Cloud: A Practical Guide

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of key security practices for hardening a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster. It focuses on three critical areas: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Network Policies, and Secrets Management.

The goal is to illustrate how to implement security controls using standard Kubernetes features and best practices to minimize the attack surface and enforce the principle of least privilege.

Project Structure:

*   README.md: This introductory file.
*   rbac/: Contains YAML definitions for ServiceAccounts, Roles, and RoleBindings to manage access permissions within the cluster.
*   network-policies/: Includes YAML examples for defining network segmentation rules, controlling ingress and egress traffic between pods and namespaces.
*   apps/: Sample application deployments (frontend and backend) used to demonstrate the effects of RBAC and Network Policies.
*   secrets/: Demonstrates basic Kubernetes Secret creation and consumption, alongside important considerations for sensitive data.
*   commands.sh: A comprehensive shell script guiding you through the deployment and verification steps for all the security configurations.

Key Concepts Covered:

1.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    *   Assigning granular permissions to users, groups, or ServiceAccounts.
    *   Enforcing the principle of least privilege by defining specific actions allowed on Kubernetes resources.
    *   Using ServiceAccounts for application identity within the cluster.

2.  Network Policies:
    *   Controlling inter-pod communication within a namespace and across namespaces.
    *   Implementing a default-deny policy and then selectively allowing necessary traffic.
    *   Securing application tiers (e.g., frontend to backend communication).

3.  Secrets Management:
    *   Understanding Kubernetes Secrets for storing sensitive data.
    *   Mounting secrets as environment variables or files into pods.
    *   Discussing the limitations of native Kubernetes Secrets and highlighting the need for external solutions (e.g., cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault) for production environments.

How to Use This Project:

1.  Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS, minikube) and kubectl configured.
2.  Review the YAML files in each directory to understand the configurations.
3.  Execute the commands.sh script step-by-step or manually run the kubectl commands to deploy the resources and observe their effects.
4.  Experiment with modifying the policies to see how changes impact application behavior and security posture.

Disclaimer:
This project provides simplified examples for educational purposes. Production environments require more robust security measures, including but not limited to:
*   Advanced network segmentation with service meshes or CNI plugins.
*   Workload identity federation with cloud IAM.
*   Centralized secrets management solutions.
*   Container image scanning and runtime security.
*   Logging, monitoring, and auditing.
*   Pod Security Admission or Policy Engines like Kyverno/OPA Gatekeeper.

Always consult official Kubernetes documentation and cloud provider security best practices for production deployments.
