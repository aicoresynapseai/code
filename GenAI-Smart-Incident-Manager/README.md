Project: GenAI-Smart-Incident-Manager

Overview
This project demonstrates a practical application of Generative AI (GenAI) models for smart incident management in Java workloads. In complex distributed systems, identifying, understanding, and resolving incidents manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This solution proposes using GenAI to automate parts of this process by analyzing logs and metrics to detect anomalies, explain their root causes, and suggest resolution steps.

The core idea is to feed raw application data (like log messages) to a GenAI model, which then acts as an intelligent assistant, transforming raw data into actionable insights for incident response teams.

Core Concepts
*   Incident Detection: Automatically identify potential incidents or anomalous patterns from streams of log data and metrics.
*   Contextual Explanation: Provide human-readable explanations of what an incident is, why it occurred, and its potential impact. This goes beyond simple error messages, offering deeper insights.
*   Guided Resolution: Suggest concrete, step-by-step actions or remediation strategies to resolve the detected incident, potentially drawing from historical knowledge bases or best practices.

Architecture (Simulated)
This proof-of-concept project is a simple Spring Boot application that simulates the interaction with a GenAI model.

1.  Log Ingestion: A REST API endpoint receives application log entries (or simulated metrics).
2.  GenAI Service (Simulated): Upon receiving a log entry, a service invokes a simulated GenAI model. In a real-world scenario, this would involve API calls to a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, or a fine-tuned custom model.
3.  Incident Reporting: The GenAI service processes the log data and returns an "Incident Report" containing detection status, explanation, and resolution steps.
4.  API Response: The incident report is returned to the client, which could then integrate with alert systems, dashboards, or ticketing tools.

Simulated GenAI Interaction
For demonstration purposes, the GenAI model's behavior is simulated within the GenAIService.java. Instead of making actual API calls to an external LLM, it uses predefined patterns (e.g., searching for "OutOfMemoryError", "NullPointerException", "Timeout") within the log messages to generate plausible incident reports. This allows us to illustrate the *output* and *utility* of such a system without requiring external API keys or complex model deployments.

How to Run
1.  Prerequisites:
    *   Java 17 or higher
    *   Maven 3.6+

2.  Clone the repository:
    (Not applicable here, as this is a code block sequence, but imagine a `git clone` command)

3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd GenAI-Smart-Incident-Manager

4.  Build the project using Maven:
    mvn clean install

5.  Run the application:
    mvn spring-boot:run

6.  Test the API:
    Once the application is running (typically on http://localhost:8080), you can send POST requests to the `/api/logs` endpoint.

    Example Request (using curl):
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:8080/api/logs \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
            "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
            "serviceName": "UserService",
            "level": "ERROR",
            "message": "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"
          }'

    You can try different messages like "Database connection timed out", "NullPointerException at com.example.MyClass", or "User logged in successfully" to see varied GenAI responses.

Expected Output
The API will return a JSON object representing an `IncidentReport`, indicating if an incident was detected, its type, a detailed explanation, and suggested resolution steps, all generated by the simulated GenAI logic.

Future Enhancements
*   Integration with actual LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini).
*   Fine-tuning LLMs with historical incident data for improved accuracy.
*   Support for diverse data sources (metrics, traces, security events).
*   Integration with incident management platforms (PagerDuty, Jira, ServiceNow).
*   User interface for visualization and interaction.

This project serves as a foundational example to inspire further development in leveraging GenAI for more intelligent and automated operational workflows.
