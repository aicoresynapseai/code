Title: Smart Configuration Management in Java: GenAI at Work

This project, "GenAIConfigManager", demonstrates a conceptual framework for leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) to automate and enhance the lifecycle of configuration files (YAML, .properties) for Java applications. The core idea is to use GenAI not just for content generation, but also for intelligent validation and optimization of these critical application settings.

The current implementation simulates the GenAI interaction for demonstration purposes, focusing on the Java application's role in processing the GenAI's output.

Key Concepts Demonstrated:

*   **GenAI-Assisted Configuration Generation**: Imagine GenAI producing the initial drafts of your application's `application.yaml` or `config.properties` based on high-level prompts (e.g., "Generate config for a database connection to PostgreSQL, with logging at INFO level for `com.my.app` package."). In this project, a mock GenAI response JSON file (`genai_mock_response.json`) serves as the GenAI's output.
*   **Automated Configuration Validation**: Once GenAI generates a configuration, it's crucial to validate it against expected schemas or rules. This project shows how to programmatically check for required fields, correct data types, and structural integrity.
*   **Configuration Optimization**: GenAI might produce verbose or unoptimized configurations. This module demonstrates simple optimization techniques, such as standardizing key order, removing redundant entries, or adding comments for clarity, ensuring configurations are clean and efficient.
*   **Integration with Java Applications**: The generated and validated configurations are then consumed by a simple Java application, showcasing how this process fits into a typical development workflow.

Project Structure:

*   `pom.xml`: Defines project dependencies (e.g., for YAML parsing).
*   `src/main/java/com/genai/config/manager/GenAIConfigManagerApplication.java`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `src/main/java/com/genai/config/manager/GenAIIntegrationService.java`: Simulates calling a GenAI service and retrieving its configuration output.
*   `src/main/java/com/genai/config/manager/ConfigurationService.java`: Contains the core logic for generating, validating, and optimizing configuration files.
*   `src/main/java/com/genai/config/manager/model/AppConfig.java`: A simple Java POJO to represent parsed application configuration.
*   `src/main/resources/genai_mock_response.json`: A JSON file that acts as the mocked output from a GenAI service, containing proposed YAML and .properties content.
*   `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Standard properties file for the `GenAIConfigManager` application itself.
*   `src/main/resources/sample-config-schema.yaml`: A conceptual YAML schema, used to guide the validation process.

How to Run:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher and Maven installed.
2.  **Clone/Download**: Obtain the project files.
3.  **Navigate**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project (where `pom.xml` is located).
4.  **Build**: Execute `mvn clean install` to compile the project and download dependencies.
5.  **Run**: Execute `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.genai.config.manager.GenAIConfigManagerApplication"`
    The application will perform the following steps:
    *   Simulate GenAI output retrieval.
    *   Generate `target/generated-application.yaml` and `target/generated-application.properties`.
    *   Validate the generated files (outputting success or failure messages to the console).
    *   Optimize the generated files, creating `target/optimized-application.yaml` and `target/optimized-application.properties`.
    *   Load and display the properties from the optimized files.

This project serves as a foundational example. In a real-world scenario, the `GenAIIntegrationService` would integrate with actual GenAI APIs (like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, etc.), and the validation/optimization logic would be more sophisticated, potentially involving external schema validators (e.g., for JSON Schema) or custom rule engines.
