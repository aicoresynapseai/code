Introduction to the Linux File System Structure

Welcome to the Linux File System Tour!

This project provides a practical introduction to the hierarchical structure of the Linux file system. Understanding where files are stored and why is fundamental to navigating and managing a Linux system effectively.

The Linux file system is organized like an upside-down tree, starting from the root directory, represented by a single forward slash (/). Every file and directory on a Linux system resides under this root.

Project Contents:
- README.md: This document, explaining the project.
- scripts/explore_filesystem.sh: A shell script that guides you through various important Linux directories, explaining their purpose and showing example contents using common commands like 'ls', 'pwd', and 'cd'.

Key Directories You Will Explore:

/ (Root Directory)
The top-most directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. Everything else is contained within it.

/home
Contains the personal directories for each user. For example, a user named 'john' would have their personal files and configurations in /home/john.

/etc
(Etcetera) This directory holds system-wide configuration files. These files control how your system behaves, including network settings, user accounts, and service configurations.

/var
(Variable) Stores variable data files. This includes log files (/var/log), mail spool files (/var/mail), printer spool files (/var/var/spool), and temporary files that may change during system operation.

/bin
(Binaries) Contains essential user command binaries (executable programs) that are available to all users. Examples include 'ls', 'cp', 'mv', 'cat'.

/sbin
(System Binaries) Similar to /bin, but contains essential system administration binaries, usually reserved for the root user or users with elevated privileges. Examples include 'fdisk', 'ifconfig'.

/usr
(Unix System Resources) This is one of the largest directories and contains most user-installed applications and utilities. It's further subdivided:
  - /usr/bin: Non-essential user commands.
  - /usr/sbin: Non-essential system administration binaries.
  - /usr/local: Locally installed software that is not part of the standard distribution.
  - /usr/share: Architecture-independent data (e.g., documentation, icons).
  - /usr/lib: Libraries required by programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.

/lib and /lib64
(Libraries) Contains essential shared libraries and kernel modules required by the binaries in /bin and /sbin. /lib64 is for 64-bit systems.

/opt
(Optional) Used for installing optional, third-party software that is not part of the standard distribution. Often, large software packages install themselves entirely within a subdirectory under /opt.

/tmp
(Temporary) Stores temporary files created by the system and users. Contents of this directory are often deleted upon reboot.

/dev
(Devices) Contains special files that represent hardware devices (e.g., /dev/sda for hard drives, /dev/null for the null device). These files allow programs to interact with hardware.

/proc
(Processes) A virtual file system that provides an interface to kernel data structures. It contains information about running processes and system resources in real-time. Files here are not actual files on disk but are generated by the kernel.

/sys
(System) Another virtual file system, similar to /proc, providing an interface to kernel devices and drivers. It's often used by programs to query or configure hardware.

/srv
(Services) Contains data for services provided by the system. For example, web server data might be found in /srv/www.

/mnt
(Mount) A traditionally empty directory used as a temporary mount point for mounting file systems, such as network shares or external drives.

/media
Used as a mount point for removable media like USB drives, CDs, and DVDs.

How to Run the Tour:

1.  Make sure you are in a Linux environment or a system with a similar file system structure.
2.  Navigate to the 'scripts' directory:
    cd scripts
3.  Make the script executable:
    chmod +x explore_filesystem.sh
4.  Run the script:
    ./explore_filesystem.sh

The script will guide you through each directory, explaining its purpose and showing you examples of its contents using 'ls', 'pwd', and 'cd' commands. Pay attention to the output in your terminal!
