Welcome to the `gen-ai-iac-java-deploy` project!

This repository provides a practical demonstration of how Generative AI can be used to dynamically create Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates. It complements the "Automating Infrastructure as Code for Java Deployments" video by showcasing a conceptual GenAI system that takes a high-level service specification (in JSON or YAML) and generates cloud-provider-specific IaC (Terraform and CloudFormation) tailored for Java microservices.

**Project Goals:**

*   **Illustrate GenAI's role:** Demonstrate how a simplified GenAI logic can interpret high-level infrastructure requirements.
*   **Generate IaC:** Produce valid Terraform (`.tf`) and AWS CloudFormation (`.yaml`) files based on input.
*   **Target Java Microservices:** Focus on common components for Java applications (e.g., Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Load Balancers, API Gateways).
*   **Simulate Workflow:** Show how this generation step can fit into a CI/CD pipeline.

**How it Works (Conceptual Flow):**

1.  **High-Level Specification:** A developer or architect defines the desired Java microservice infrastructure using a structured JSON or YAML file (e.g., `input_config_java_microservice.json`). This file describes the application name, environment, desired components (Spring Boot app, database, API Gateway), and their high-level characteristics.
2.  **GenAI Generation Script:** The Python script (`gen-ai-iac-generator.py`) acts as our "GenAI." It reads the input specification, interprets the requirements, and then dynamically constructs the necessary cloud resources.
3.  **IaC Output:** The script outputs two infrastructure files:
    *   `generated_main.tf`: A Terraform configuration file for AWS.
    *   `generated_cloudformation.yaml`: An AWS CloudFormation template.
4.  **CI/CD Integration (Simulation):** A simple shell script (`simulate_ci_cd.sh`) demonstrates how this generation step would integrate into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline, followed by typical IaC validation and deployment steps (e.g., `terraform plan`).

**Contents of this Repository:**

*   `gen-ai-iac-generator.py`: The core Python script that simulates the GenAI logic.
*   `input_config_java_microservice.json`: A sample input specification in JSON format.
*   `input_config_java_microservice_alt.yaml`: An alternative sample input specification in YAML format.
*   `generated_main.tf` (generated): The Terraform file output by the script.
*   `generated_cloudformation.yaml` (generated): The CloudFormation file output by the script.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed for the generator script.
*   `simulate_ci_cd.sh`: A shell script to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow.

**Setup and Running:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x
    *   Terraform CLI (optional, for `terraform plan` simulation)
    *   AWS CLI (optional, for `aws cloudformation validate-template` simulation)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-iac-java-deploy.git
    cd gen-ai-iac-java-deploy

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Run the GenAI generator:**
    python gen-ai-iac-generator.py --input-file input_config_java_microservice.json --output-terraform generated_main.tf --output-cloudformation generated_cloudformation.yaml

5.  **Simulate CI/CD (optional, if Terraform/AWS CLI are installed):**
    ./simulate_ci_cd.sh

This project serves as a conceptual blueprint, demonstrating the power and potential of integrating Generative AI into your DevOps workflows for Java microservice deployments.
