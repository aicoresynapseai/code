    "question": "What is Spring Boot?",

    "question": "Explain a Git workflow for Java projects.",
    "answer": "A common Git workflow for Java projects involves a 'feature branch' approach. Developers create separate branches for new features or bug fixes, work on them independently, and then merge them back into a 'develop' or 'main' branch after code review and testing. This ensures stable releases and collaborative development."

  {
    "question": "What is a microservice architecture?",
    "answer": "Microservice architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services, modeled around a business domain. Each service is self-contained, independently deployable, and communicates with others via lightweight mechanisms like REST APIs. This contrasts with monolithic applications."

  {
    "question": "Why is immutable infrastructure important in DevOps?",
    "answer": "Immutable infrastructure means that servers and other infrastructure components are never modified after they're deployed. Instead, if a change is needed, a new component is built from a common base image with the changes, and the old one is replaced. This reduces configuration drift, improves consistency, and simplifies rollbacks, making deployments more reliable."
