Welcome to PyFunPro - Python Functions Professional!

This project is designed to help you understand the core concepts of functions in Python, including:
- Defining functions
- Passing parameters (arguments)
- Returning values
- Default parameters
- Arbitrary arguments (*args)
- Arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs)

The project consists of two main Python files:
1.  src/calculator.py: Contains various function definitions.
2.  src/main.py: Demonstrates how to import and use these functions.

How to Run the Project:

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the 'PyFunPro' directory in your terminal.
3.  Execute the main script:
    python src/main.py

You will see the output of the function calls directly in your terminal, illustrating how each function works.

File Breakdown:

- src/calculator.py: This file acts as a module containing several reusable functions. Each function is designed to showcase a specific aspect of Python functions.
- src/main.py: This is the entry point of our demonstration. It imports functions from src/calculator.py and calls them with different inputs to display their behavior and return values.

Learning Objectives:

By exploring this project, you will learn:
- How to structure your code into reusable functions.
- The difference between positional and keyword arguments.
- How to handle an unknown number of arguments.
- The importance of return values for function output.

Feel free to modify the files, add new functions, or experiment with different parameters to deepen your understanding.
