PyDataExplorer: Working with Lists and Dictionaries in Python

Welcome to PyDataExplorer! This project serves as an introductory guide to two fundamental data structures in Python: Lists and Dictionaries. It demonstrates how to store multiple values, access individual elements, modify their content, and iterate through them effectively.

What you will learn:
- Creating and initializing lists.
- Accessing list elements by index and using slicing.
- Modifying, adding, and removing elements from lists.
- Iterating over lists.
- Creating and initializing dictionaries.
- Accessing dictionary values by keys.
- Adding, modifying, and removing key-value pairs in dictionaries.
- Iterating over dictionary keys, values, and items.
- Practical examples combining lists and dictionaries.

How to Run the Project:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the root directory of this project (where the src folder is located).
3.  **Run the main script**: Execute the following command:
    python src/main.py

The script will then print a series of examples and explanations directly to your console, illustrating the concepts of lists and dictionaries in action.
