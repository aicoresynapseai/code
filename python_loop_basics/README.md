Title: Loops â€“ for and while in Python

Description : This project provides practical examples of 'for' and 'while' loops in Python. It covers common use cases like iterating over lists, ranges, strings, dictionaries, and files. You'll learn how to control loop flow using 'break' and 'continue', and understand the 'else' block with loops.

How to Run:

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended).
2. Navigate to the 'python_loop_basics' directory in your terminal.
3. Run the main script: python main.py

Key Concepts Covered:

- Basic 'for' loop for list, range, string, and dictionary iteration.
- Using 'enumerate' for index and value.
- Using 'zip' for parallel iteration.
- Basic 'while' loop with a counter.
- Infinite 'while' loops with 'break'.
- The 'continue' statement to skip iterations.
- The 'else' block for 'for' and 'while' loops.
- File iteration using a 'for' loop.
