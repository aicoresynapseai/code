Python Flow Control: Decision Making with if, elif, else

Purpose:
This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of control flow in Python, specifically focusing on conditional statements (if, elif, else) and comparison operators. It provides interactive examples to illustrate how Python makes decisions based on the truthiness of expressions.

How it works:
The main script, main.py, takes user input and uses it to evaluate various conditions, showing how Python executes different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Basic 'if' statement: Executes code only if a condition is true.
- 'if-else' statement: Provides two execution paths based on a condition's truthiness.
- 'if-elif-else' statement: Allows for checking multiple conditions in sequence.
- Usage of Comparison Operators: == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), >= (greater than or equal).
- Usage of Logical Operators: 'and', 'or', 'not' for combining conditions.
- Simple user interaction: Prompts for input to make demonstrations dynamic.

How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended).
2. Navigate to the 'python_flow_control' directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the Python interpreter:
   python main.py

Expected Output:
The script will print introductory messages, then prompt you to enter various inputs (like age, test score, numbers). Based on your input, it will print different messages that explain which conditional block was executed, thereby illustrating the decision-making process in Python.
