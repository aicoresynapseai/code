Project Title: AWS IAM Best Practices Automation

Introduction
This project demonstrates key Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices within Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and scripting (Python Boto3). Effective IAM is crucial for securing cloud resources by controlling who (or what) can access what, under which conditions.

IAM Best Practices Covered
1.  IAM Roles: We illustrate the creation and use of IAM roles for applications and services, promoting the principle of least privilege. Roles allow you to delegate permissions without sharing long-term credentials.
2.  Least Privilege Access: This fundamental security principle ensures that users, roles, and services are granted only the permissions absolutely necessary to perform their intended tasks, and nothing more. We show how to define granular policies.
3.  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA adds an essential layer of security by requiring more than one method of verification to log in or perform sensitive actions. Our Python script shows how to provision virtual MFA devices.
4.  Automation of IAM Policy Creation: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform enable you to define and manage IAM resources, including roles and policies, in a version-controlled and repeatable manner, reducing manual errors and increasing consistency.

Prerequisites
*   An active AWS account.
*   AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials and default region.
*   Terraform installed (version 1.0 or higher).
*   Python 3.x installed.
*   Boto3 library installed (pip install boto3).

How to Use This Project

1.  Terraform for IAM Role and Policy Automation
    This section automates the creation of an IAM role with a least-privilege policy.

    a.  Navigate to the project root directory.
    b.  Initialize Terraform:
        terraform init
    c.  Review the planned changes (optional but recommended):
        terraform plan
    d.  Apply the Terraform configuration to create resources:
        terraform apply --auto-approve
    e.  Once finished, you can find the created IAM Role ARN in the Terraform outputs.
    f.  To clean up the resources created by Terraform:
        terraform destroy --auto-approve

2.  Python for IAM User and MFA Device Automation
    This Python script demonstrates how to create an IAM user, attach an existing policy, and set up a virtual MFA device.

    a.  Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with permissions to create IAM users, attach policies, and manage MFA devices.
    b.  Navigate to the scripts directory:
        cd scripts
    c.  Run the Python script:
        python create_iam_user.py
    d.  The script will prompt for a username. It will then create the user, attach a read-only S3 policy, and generate a Base32 string for a virtual MFA device.
    e.  To complete MFA setup:
        i.  Copy the Base32 string.
        ii. In the AWS console, navigate to IAM > Users > [Your New User] > Security credentials > Assigned MFA device.
        iii. Click "Manage" and then "Activate virtual MFA device".
        iv. Select "Scan QR code" and paste the Base32 string into the "Show secret key" field.
        v. Enter two consecutive MFA codes from your authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
        vi. Click "Assign MFA".
    f.  To clean up the user created by the script, you would typically use the AWS console or AWS CLI:
        aws iam delete-virtual-mfa-device --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:mfa/<USERNAME>
        aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name <USERNAME> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
        aws iam delete-user --user-name <USERNAME>

Key Takeaways
*   Use IAM roles for services and applications, not IAM users with long-term credentials.
*   Always apply the principle of least privilege: grant only the necessary permissions.
*   Enforce MFA for all human users to enhance security.
*   Automate IAM resource management with IaC (Terraform) and scripting (Boto3) for consistency, security, and scalability.

This project provides a foundational example. In a real-world scenario, policies would be more finely tuned, and more robust error handling and logging would be implemented.
