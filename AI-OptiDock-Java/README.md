Project Title: AI-OptiDock-Java: Accelerating Java Microservice Deployment with AI-Driven Dockerization

Overview:
This project demonstrates a conceptual approach to accelerating Java microservice deployment by leveraging AI (specifically, Generative AI tools) to recommend and generate optimized Dockerfiles. Often, developers create Dockerfiles manually, which might not always be fully optimized for size, security, or build speed. An AI-driven system can analyze the project, identify dependencies, infer best practices, and suggest or directly generate a highly optimized Dockerfile.

The aim is to showcase:
- A sample Java Spring Boot microservice.
- A simulated AI recommendation script that generates an optimized Dockerfile.
- The structure of an AI-recommended Dockerfile with key optimizations highlighted.
- How this AI-driven process can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

Key Components:
1.  **Java Spring Boot Microservice:** A simple 'Hello World' REST API built with Spring Boot and Maven.
2.  **AI Recommendation Script (Python):** This script simulates a GenAI tool. Instead of calling a real LLM, it contains predefined logic to "recommend" an optimized Dockerfile. It highlights the rationale behind the recommendations (e.g., multi-stage build, lean base image, non-root user, layer caching). In a real-world scenario, this script would interact with an AI service, feeding it project metadata (language, framework, dependencies) and receiving an optimized Dockerfile as output.
3.  **Optimized Dockerfile:** The Dockerfile generated by the AI simulation, demonstrating best practices for Java microservices.
4.  **Local Build Script:** A bash script to demonstrate the local build process, integrating the AI recommendation step.
5.  **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** A GitLab CI/CD pipeline example showing how the AI-driven Dockerfile generation can be seamlessly integrated into an automated deployment workflow.

How it Works (Conceptual Flow):
1.  **Code Commit:** Developer pushes Java microservice code to a Git repository.
2.  **CI/CD Trigger:** The CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
3.  **Java Build:** The pipeline first builds the Java application (e.g., using Maven).
4.  **AI Dockerfile Recommendation:** A dedicated pipeline stage invokes the AI recommendation script. This script analyzes the built artifact, project type, and pre-configured optimization goals (simulated in this demo). It then generates or updates the 'Dockerfile.recommended' file with the optimized content.
5.  **Docker Image Build:** The pipeline then uses the newly generated 'Dockerfile.recommended' to build the Docker image.
6.  **Image Push/Deployment:** The Docker image is pushed to a container registry and then deployed to the target environment.

Getting Started (Local Execution):

Prerequisites:
- Java 17+
- Apache Maven
- Docker
- Python 3

Steps:

1.  Navigate to the project root directory:
    cd AI-OptiDock-Java

2.  Build the Java microservice:
    mvn clean package

3.  Simulate AI Dockerfile Recommendation (this step will generate or update 'Dockerfile.recommended'):
    python3 recommend_dockerfile.py

4.  Build the Docker image using the recommended Dockerfile:
    docker build -t ai-optidock-java:latest -f Dockerfile.recommended .

5.  Run the Docker container:
    docker run -p 8080:8080 ai-optidock-java:latest

6.  Test the API:
    Open your browser or use curl:
    curl http://localhost:8080/api/hello

Expected Output:
Hello from AI-OptiDock-Java!

Integration with CI/CD:
Refer to the .gitlab-ci.yml file for how these steps can be automated in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline. The core idea is to introduce a step that executes the 'recommend_dockerfile.py' script *before* the Docker build step.

Benefits of AI-Driven Dockerization:
- **Optimization:** Automatically generates smaller, more secure, and faster-building Docker images.
- **Consistency:** Ensures best practices are applied uniformly across all microservices.
- **Speed:** Reduces manual effort and potential errors in Dockerfile creation.
- **Adaptability:** AI can quickly adapt to new best practices or specific environment requirements.
- **Security:** Helps identify and mitigate common Docker security vulnerabilities.
